# Inverted Pendulum Control with MATLAB

This repository contains the MATLAB code and documentation of an undergraduate thesis completed in 1998.

## 📌 Thesis Title
**Inverted Pendulum Control Using MATLAB**  
*(Ters Sarkaç Sisteminin MATLAB ile Kontrolü)*

## 🧠 Abstract
The inverted pendulum system is a classical benchmark problem in control theory and is widely used to demonstrate and compare control strategies.  
This thesis focuses on the control of a cart–inverted pendulum system using **state-space based modern control methods**.

The main objective of the study is to stabilize the inverted pendulum on a moving cart and bring the cart back to its initial position using **pole placement** and **symmetric root-locus (SRL)** techniques implemented in MATLAB.

## 🛠️ Methods & Techniques
- State-space modeling
- Linearized inverted pendulum model
- Pole placement control
- Symmetric Root-Locus (SRL)
- Time-domain analysis
- MATLAB-based simulation

## 📂 Repository Structure
/SRL_K.m - Symmetric Root-Locus plot generation
/TEZ_K.m - Controller design using SRL-selected poles
/TEZ_SBB.m - Unit step response (SRL-based control)
/TEZ_GK.m - Controller with user-defined poles
/TEZ_GBB.m - Unit step response (general pole selection)

## 📊 Results
Simulation results are presented as MATLAB-generated plots showing system response and stability characteristics under different pole selection strategies.
